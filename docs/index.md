# Documentation Index

Current status: this repository is a DeepDive application and project bootstrap for the Newton Primitive Collision Compiler. It now contains config dry-run reporting, USD asset-open smoke diagnostics, Newton source import diagnostics, and local environment-readiness diagnostics. It does not yet contain primitive fitting, Newton simulation probe execution, benchmark results, or LLM/VLM research code.

Current next action: use the clean Python 3.10 Newton environment readiness record to start the
first 0-4 week milestone: a non-LLM primitive baseline plus Newton diagnostic checker before
considering LLM/VLM components.

## DeepDive Package

- [DeepDive README](deepdive/README.md): reviewer-facing navigation and editing rules.
- [Message Map](deepdive/message-map.md): canonical story, safe wording, unsafe claims, proof point, and support request.
- [Application Draft](deepdive/application.md): realistic DeepDive application text.
- [One-Page Summary](deepdive/one-page-summary.md): concise leadership and reviewer brief.
- [Pitch Outline](deepdive/pitch-outline.md): 20-30 minute talk structure.
- [Review Q&A](deepdive/review-qa.md): preparation for Taste, Benchmark, User Experience, and Value Delivering.
- [Evidence Status](deepdive/evidence-status.md): what is supported now, what is future evidence, and what must not be claimed.

## Design References

- [Project Scope](design/project-scope.md): project boundaries, current non-goals, and staged ambition.
- [System Architecture](design/system-architecture.md): intended compiler components and current skeleton status.
- [Research Roadmap](design/research-roadmap.md): Phase 0 through Phase 4 route.
- [Evaluation Plan](design/evaluation-plan.md): baselines, tasks, metrics, reporting, phase gates, and no-go criteria.
- [Benchmark Protocol](design/benchmark-protocol.md): asset categories, license policy, normalization, splits, task templates, and failure taxonomy.

## Source Intake And Planning

- [Temporary source documents](tmp/): quarantined source intake used during bootstrap; not
  canonical reviewer-facing claims.
- [Environment readiness operations](operations/environment.md): local runtime contract, required
  variables, readiness command, status meanings, and artifact policy.
- [Bootstrap plan](superpowers/plans/2026-05-14-deepdive-first-repo-bootstrap.md): implementation checklist.
- [Bootstrap design](superpowers/specs/2026-05-14-deepdive-first-repo-bootstrap-design.md): original design rationale.
- [Environment normalization design](superpowers/specs/2026-05-14-environment-normalization-design.md):
  Phase 1 environment-readiness scope and claim boundary.
- [Environment normalization plan](superpowers/plans/2026-05-14-environment-normalization.md):
  TDD implementation plan for the readiness checker and docs.

## Configs And Artifacts

- `configs/deepdive/mvp.yaml`: DeepDive-facing dry-run MVP config.
- `configs/experiments/phase0_baseline.yaml`: Phase 0 proof-point config scaffold.
- `scripts/env/readiness_check.py`: local environment-readiness JSON checker.
- `experiments/registry.yaml`: experiment registry and claim-support status.
- `assets/`, `reports/`, and `archive/`: artifact boundaries; large/generated outputs stay out
  of git.
- `AGENTS.md`: repo-local rules for future agentic work.

## Claim Boundary

Safe current claim: proposal for primitive-first, Newton-checker-planned, fallback-aware collision asset compilation.

Additional current evidence: executable environment-readiness diagnostics can record dependency
gaps, source provenance, and the current clean local env `smoke_passed` status. This is not Newton
simulation evidence.

Current non-goals: no safety guarantee, no real-world transfer claim, no deployment readiness claim, no benchmark superiority claim, no CPD reproduction claim, and no complete replacement of convex decomposition.
